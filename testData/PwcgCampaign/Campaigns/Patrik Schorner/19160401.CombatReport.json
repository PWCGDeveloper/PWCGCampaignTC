  "narrative": "\n\n\n\nWe arrive at the area and I circle madly looking for my target.  Finally I see it .  An attack on a rail yard.  I execute a beautiful bombing pass and explode several train cars.  Unfortinately, the locomotive escapes before we arrive.  I shoot up a control tower at an enemy air base on the way home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
