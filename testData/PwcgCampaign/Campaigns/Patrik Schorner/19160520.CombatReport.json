  "narrative": "\nWe poounce on a group of French pushers.  I get behinfd and below one of them and fire.  The Frenchman takes evasive action and the fighht is on.  I fire into  the cockpit and kill the pilot.  As the plane begins to sspin down the observer gets a clean shot.  He hit me and my engine.  I nudge the Fokker towards a town and land just outside of it. My injuries cost me a month at the front.  \n\nIn my absence Immelman is lost. Kurt Wintgens has joined our company,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
