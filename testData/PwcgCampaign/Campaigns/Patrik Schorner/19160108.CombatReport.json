  "narrative": "\nMy first mission is quite eventful   We are accosted by Nieuports as we were in our climb pattern.  The Nieuports were set upon by Fokkers from Jasta 5.  Two attacked us and we bring both down.  I am credited with a victory.  \n\nWe continue on to bomb the terget.  Unfortunately our high altitude attack misses the mark and causes no damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
